      <h1 class="text-center">I'm here to help</h1>
      <p class="text-center textblock">My name is Nathanael Dehn, living in near Berlin/Germany. I finished my training as a graphic designer in Greifswald. At my young age of 24 years I've already been through quite a long journey. My interests of being creative and helping others started developing at an early time. Later in life I had various apprenticeships in car shops, media companies and other place where I've learned what I want to do. My goal is to primarily help people. In graphic design I can work directly with people and help them find a solution for their problems. This website is giving you a little inside into my work.
      </br></br>
      There is more about me, besides graphic design, more ways of being creative. I love playing instruments and making music. Even though I am able to play multiple instruments, the piano and the guitar are my favorites. I like to play just for emotional reasons or to create a new instrumental title. Music has always been a great way of expressing myself and it is a big part of my life.
      If you are more interested in the visuals, feel free to check out my Instagram account. There you can see a lot of side projects and other passions of mine such as hand lettering and photography.<br/><br/>
